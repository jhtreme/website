        <p>Chicken Jalfrezi is a delightfully flavorful curry with tender, juicy chunks of chicken in a spicy tomato sauce studded with stir-fried peppers and onions.</p>
       
        
      
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <!-- <p>spice mix</p> -->
        <ul>
        <li>2 tsp indian restaurant spice mix or curry powder – recipe link below
        <li>1 tsp kashmiri chili powder or 1/4 tsp cayenne mixed with 3/4 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp kasoor methi – dried fenugreek leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp tandoori masala</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt
        <li>The curry ingredients</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp neutral oil – e.g vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped green pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp garlic/ginger paste – recipe link below</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp tomato paste with enough water to dilute to the consistency of pasatta</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp cilantro stems – finely chopped</li>
        <li>15 oz curry base – recipe link below</li>
        <li>10-12 oz pre-cooked chicken or lamb</li>
        <li>2 finger hot green chilies cut into half then split</li>
        <li>4 cherry tomatoes halved</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Method</h4>
        
       <p>Make the spice mix.
        Dilute the tomato paste with enough water to get to the consistency of passata.
        Heat your frying pan (don’t use non-stick) briefly over medium heat. Add the oil. 
        the oil starts to shimmer add the onions and green peppers and stir every few seconds. You want the green peppers to be skin side down as much as possible. Fry until the pepper starts to blister and the onion edges turn brown.
            Next comes the garlic ginger paste and the cilantro stems. Add them into the pan and cook it, stirring constantly, until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering.
            Turn down the heat and add the spice mix. This is the critical step. Stir it constantly for 30 seconds. If it starts to darken lift the pan off the heat. You want the spice mix to cook in the oil but not burn.
            Turn the heat up to medium high. Add the diluted tomato paste and stir until bubbles form (the oil will likely separate). This takes around 30 seconds to one minute depending on the heat.
            Add 3 oz of curry base. Stir until bubbles form (little craters really), around 30 seconds. Watch the edges of the pan. The curry can stick here.
            Now add 6 oz of curry base and stir briefly. Let it cook until the bubbles form again. This takes 1-2 minutes.
            Add the rest of the curry base and let cook until the bubbles form. Turn the heat down to low and add the pre-cooked lamb, beef or chicken and the green chilies.
            Let the curry simmer for about 5 minutes. If it gets too thick add a bit more curry base. Don’t add water. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook until they are heated through.
            Garnish with a bit of chopped fresh cilantro and serve.</p><br>

        <h3 id="gobi">Ghobi Kashmiri Recipe</h3>
        <img src="images\kashmiri1.jpg" alt="Gobi Kashmiri">
        <br>
        
        <p>Cauliflower curry cooked with spices, cream, cashews and raisins </p>
        
        
        
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>1 Small Cauliflower ,break into small/medium florets</li>
        <li>½ Cup Greek Yoghurt/Any Vegan Yoghurt</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Fennel Powder</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Dry Ginger powder</li>
        <li>1.5 Tsp Kashmiri Red Chili Powder</li>
        <li>Pinch of Garam Masala Powder</li>
        <li>½ Tsp Turmeric Powder</li>
        <li>Salt according to the taste.</li>
        <li>1 Black Cardamom</li>
        <li>½ Tsp Cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Oil to cook the Curry</li>
        <li>Oil for frying the cauliflower if you are deep frying .</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <p> Wash cauliflower with water and dry with a paper towel.
            Cut florets .I will suggest go for natural floret shapes and break them with hand .
            Deep fry or air fry them according to your choice.
            Take precaution while deep frying .Oil will splutter all over the pan so its always better to keep a lid ready .Once you put florets ,cover it immediately .Leave it just like that for 3-4 minute on medium fame .Remove the lid and then fry it properly till it looks golden .
            Remove it in a plate lined with paper towel.
            Take a pan or wok or use the same one. Just reduce the oil. We need around 1 tbsp.
            Heat it.
            Meanwhile make a paste of all the ground spices with ½ cup of water. Keep it aside.
            Add cumin seeds and black cardamom to it .</p>
