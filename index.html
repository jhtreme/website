        <h3>Introduction to the cuisine of curries</h3>
        <p>Lost in the realms of pre-recorded history. Pre-dating the Pharaohs some 7000 years back. This cuisine has been refined and handed down from mother to daughter, father to son and chef to chef mostly by word of mouth .</p>
            <p>Such dishes have names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods. Outside the Indian subcontinent, a curry is a dish from Southeast Asia which uses coconut milk or spice pastes, commonly eaten over rice. Curries may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Others are vegetarian. Dry curries are cooked using small amounts of liquid, which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture. Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on broth, coconut cream or coconut milk, dairy cream or yogurt, or legume purée, sautéed crushed onion, or tomato purée.</p>
