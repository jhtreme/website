        <h3>Introduction to the cuisine</h3>
        
        <p>Indians are known for their unique taste and experimental behavior when it comes to food. Many Indian desserts are fried foods made with sugar, milk or condensed milk. Ingredients and preferred types of dessert vary by region. In the eastern part of India, for example, most are based on milk products. Many are flavoured with almonds and pistachios, spiced with cardamon, nutmeg, cloves and black pepper, and decorated with nuts, or with gold or silver leaf.</p>

<li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
<li>Milk Powder</li>
<li>Yogurt</li>
<li>Cardamom & Fennel</li>

    <h4>Method</h4>
    <p> Step 1 Prepare Malpua batter
        Malpua is a delicious recipe soaked in sugar syrup. Here’s a simple way of preparing this dish at home by following some very easy and simple steps. Take a bowl and mix together khoya, maida and sooji or semolina. Next, add cardamom powder and mix well once again. Gradually add water to prepare the Malpua batter. Ensure that the mixture has a pourable consistency and is not too thick. Once the batter is ready, keep it aside for few minutes. Take a small bowl and soak saffron in water to make saffron water.</p>
        <p>Step 2 Fry the malpua and garnish with rabri and pistachios and serve
        Now, heat oil in a pan over a low flame. When the oil is hot enough, pour a ladleful of the mixture and spread evenly. Keep the flame low and cook until the malpua is golden from both sides. Remove the cooked malpua and drain the excess oil. Drop the malpua in sugar syrup and allow it to soak for 10 minutes. Repeat the same with the remaining batter. Drain the malpuas from the syrup, garnish with pistachios, saffron water and rabri. Serve immediately.></p>
